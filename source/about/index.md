## Privay Notice

The owner of this blog, Mr. Lange, does not collect data, therefor data processing of personal data doesn't take place.

### Hosting

Our hosting provider collects the following data in so-called log files, which your browser transmits:

- IP address  
- Address of the previously visited website (referrer request header)  
- Date and time of the request  
- Time zone difference from Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)  
- Content of the request  
- HTTP status code  
- Amount of data transferred  
- Website from which the request originated  
- Information about the browser and operating system

This data is necessary to display our website and to ensure its stability and security. This constitutes a legitimate interest pursuant to **Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f GDPR**.

No tracking takes place, and we do not have direct access to this data.

We use the following hosting provider to make our website available:

**GitHub Inc.**  
88 Colin P Kelly Jr St  
San Francisco, CA 94107  
United States

GitHub is the recipient of your personal data. This is in our legitimate interest pursuant to **Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f GDPR**, as it enables us to operate our website without maintaining a server on our premises. The server location is the **USA**.

Further information on GitHubâ€™s privacy policy and options for objection and deletion can be found at:  
[https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#github-pages](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#github-pages)

You have the right to object to this processing. Whether the objection is successful must be determined through a balancing of interests.

The data will be deleted as soon as the purpose of the processing no longer applies.

The processing of the data listed in this section is neither legally nor contractually required. However, the functionality of the website cannot be guaranteed without such processing.

GitHub has implemented compliance measures for international data transfers. These apply to all global activities where GitHub processes personal data of individuals in the EU. These measures are based on the **EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)**. More information can be found at:  
[https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-data-protection-addendum#attachment-1â€“the-standard-contractual-clauses-processors](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-data-protection-addendum#attachment-1â€“the-standard-contractual-clauses-processors)

### Legal Notice

In principle, a data processing agreement must be concluded with the hosting provider. However, the **Bavarian Data Protection Authority (BayLDA)** has made an exception for hosting purely static websites.

If the website is used for self-presentation purposes (e.g., by associations or small businesses), no personal data is transmitted to the operator, and no tracking takes place, then it is not considered data processing on behalf.

The authority further states:

> "The fact that even when hosting static websites, IP addresses â€“ i.e., personal data â€“ must inevitably be processed does not lead to the assumption of commissioned data processing. That would not be appropriate. The (short-term) storage of IP addresses is rather attributable to the telecommunications access provision of the website host under the TKG and primarily serves the hostâ€™s security purposes."

We assume this exception applies to GitHub Pages.
